Network Streaming is an experimental feature of Project Stellar that enables
you to play ISO images directly over your network on the original Xbox.

This functionality allows you to stream game images from a network location,
eliminating the need for physical discs or transferring files to local storage.
By leveraging your existing network infrastructure, Network Streaming provides a
convenient way to access and enjoy your game library.

- **Unlimited Storage:** Network streaming bypasses all drive size limits and has been tested with network shares larger than 100TB. No longer are you bound by the physical constraints of internal or external drives; your entire library can now live on a centralized server, accessible with just a few clicks.
- **Simple Setup:** Setting up an SMB2 server is incredibly straightforward across various platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and RetroNAS. Best of all, it requires no custom or homebrew server applications. If you already have a network share configured, you're halfway there.
- **Broad Image Support:** Whether you’re using ISO, XISO, CSO, or REDUMP images, NetISO handles them all seamlessly. This versatility ensures that whatever format your game backups are in, they’ll work without a hitch.
No More Splitting: Splitting large ISO images is no longer required. Enjoy the ease of playing your games as they were meant to be, without the tedious task of dividing files into smaller parts.
