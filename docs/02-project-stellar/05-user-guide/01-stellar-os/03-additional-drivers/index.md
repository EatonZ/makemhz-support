:::info
You might need to reconnect Xbox One controllers each time the system resets its USB ports. Such resets can occur during system boot-up or reboot, when launching a new title, or if a game executes a soft-reset.

This requirement stems from a known firmware issue in the Xbox One controller. We are currently investigating a solution and hope to implement a workaround that will effectively address this problem in a future update.
