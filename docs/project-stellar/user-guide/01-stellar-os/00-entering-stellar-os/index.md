# Entering StellarOS
When you power on your Xbox console with Project Stellar, you'll see a prompt at the bottom of your screen that reads 'Press START to Enter Setup'. This allows you to directly access the settings and configurations of StellarOS.

:::tip
If you turn on the Xbox using the DVD eject button, StellarOS will initiate in ``Safe Mode``.

This feature acts as a safety net for instances where incorrect system settings or other issues hinder the standard boot-up of StellarOS. You'll find an in-depth exploration of ``Safe Mode`` in subsequent sections.
